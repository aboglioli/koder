Meanwhile Gonderella was looking out the window. She wondered what it would be
like to live free.

At that moment many birds came to the window to communicate the king's decision.

She was amazed and prepared to listen to them.

```go
import "brain"

func (p *Princess) Think() string {
  thoughts := make([]brain.Thought, 100)
  
  for words := range p.ear {
    getDistractedThinkingOfCharmingPrince() // TODO: optimize
    thought := brain.Process(words)
    thoughts = append(thoughts, thought)
  }
  
  p.mouth <- brain.ShapeThoughts(thoughts)
}

func (p *Princess) ChatWithBirds(birds []Bird) {
  for _, b := range birds {
    p.ear <- b.message
  }
}

func main() {
  princess := newPrincess()
  princess.ear = make(chan string, 3), // listen to 3 birds at same time
  princess.mouth = make(chan string),
  
  birds := natureRepository.GetBirds()
  
  go princess.ChatWithBirds(birds)
  go princess.Think()
  
  response := <-p.mouth
  
  p.Speak(response)
}
```

— I'm so happy! Fly and tell everyone I'm going to meet my soul mate.
