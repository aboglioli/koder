*Maybe I should stop being so evil*, PHP thought.

— Yes, you are so evil —said his friend, the little Perl, a dead squirrel.

```go
import (
  "time"
  "math/rand"
  "os"
)

type OutsideEvents struct {
  rain chan bool
  attack chan People
  birdsSingingTooDamnLoudAfterADragonHangover chan bool
}

func (d *Dragon) DestroyEverything() {
  os.Exit(127)
}

func (d *Dragon) Think(e OutsideEvents) {
  r := rand.Intn(300) + 1

  select {
    case who := <-e.attack:
      d.Attack(&who)
    case <-e.birdsSingingTooDamnLoudAfterADragonHangover:
      // The Birds Effect (similar to The Butterfly Effect
      // but against dragons with a hangover)
      d.DestroyEverything()
    case <-time.After(time.Duration(r) * time.Minute):
      d.StopBeingSoEvil()
  }
}
```

Dragon's brain was working... The fate of the Universe was at stake. It could
only be saved if people and birds did not take any action. But do you know
people who do not screw things up?

The caravan of people from the Linux kingdom would arrive in 3 hours and 22
minutes...

What was the problem? Dragon's brain ran on [The Go
Playground](https://play.golang.org) and he had forgotten to seed his brain's
time.

*(Psst! Here it is... The dragon's [brain](https://play.golang.org/p/hlVSNQflDrq))*

His brain was stuck in time that's why he did not get older. Precisely on
`2009-11-10 23:00:00`. And if time does not run there is no randomness.

> — The time in the playground always starts at the same time to make the
playground deterministic. Last but not least, the rand package default seed is 1
which will make the result deterministic. If you place a
`rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())` you'll receive different results at each
execution. Note that this won't work on the playground for the same reason
above: `time.Now()` will always return the same value in every playground to
make it deterministic

So the time before he stopped being evil would be 4 hours and 2 minutes. Great!
