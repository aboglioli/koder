In a very distant kingdom, Cplusplus, an old and wise king heard the news from
his messenger pigeon, StackOverflowwy.

Somebody had to do something.

— Delphi, bring me my pants —said to his wife—. It's time. We have to stop the overflow.

— You have to take the medication honey —she answered.

— Bring me the potion too.

```go
import mirtha "git.cretaceous.com/mirtha-legrand" 
import fernet "github.com/argentina/cordoba"
import "git.kernel.org/linux"

type King struct {
  kingdom *Kingdom
  age uint64
  pants boolean
  potion uint8
}

func newKing(wife *Queen) *King {
  potion := fernet.MixWith("Coca", 1/2, 1/2), // a good fifty-fifty

  return &King {
    kingdom: &linux.Compile(),
    age: mirtha.Age,
    pants: wife.TakePants(),
    potion: potion.Drink(),
  }
}
```

He went out on the balcony.

— There is a princess who needs our help. This is a call for all the warriors of
this kingdom. Take your weapons and go rescue her from the evil dragon.

The people went crazy. Each inhabitant took what was nearby and went hunting the
dragon.
