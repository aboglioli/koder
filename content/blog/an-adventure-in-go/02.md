In a very distant kingdom, Cplusplus, an old and wise king heard the news from
his messenger pigeon, StackOverflowwy.

Somebody had to do something.

— Delphi, bring me my pants —said to his wife—. It's time. We have to stop the overflow.

— You have to take the medication honey —she answered.

— Bring me the potion too.

```go
import mirtha "git.cretaceous.com/mirtha-legrand" 
import fernet "github.com/argentina/cordoba"
import "git.kernel.org/linux"
import "pants"

interface PantsGiver {
  Take() <-chan pants.Pants
}

type King struct {
  kingdom *Kingdom
  name string
  age uint64
  wisdom uint8
  pants pants.Pants
  potion uint8
}

type Queen struct {
  kingdom *Kingdom
  name string
  age uint64
}

// better than a io.Reader
func (k *King) TakePantsFrom(p PantsGiver) {
  k.pants := <-p.Take()
}

func (q *Queen) MakePotion() fernet.FernetWithCoca {
  return fernet.MixWith("Coca", 1/2, 1/2), // a good fifty-fifty
}

func newKingAndQueen() (*King, *Queen) {
  kingdom := &linux.Compile(),

  wife := &Queen{
    kingdom: kingdom,
    name: "Delphi",
    age: mirtha.Age,
  }
  
  husband := &King{
    kingdom: kingdom,
    name: "Cplusplus",
    age: mirtha.Age,
    pants: pants,
    potion: potion.Drink(),
  }
  
  husband.TakePantsFrom(wife);
  potion := wife.MakePotion()

  husband.potion = potion.Happiness()
  
  return husband, wife
}
```

He went out on the balcony.

— There is a princess who needs our help. This is a call for all the warriors of
this kingdom. Take your weapons and go rescue her from the evil dragon.

The people went crazy. Each inhabitant took what was nearby and went hunting the
dragon.

```go
import ( 
  "sync" 
  "git.kernel.org/linux"
)

type Weapon {
  sync.Mutex
  damage uint8
}

type ArmedDweller struct {
  dweller *linux.Dweller
  weapon *Weapon
}

func prepareToFight(k *Kingdom) []ArmedDweller {
  farmers, warriors := k.Population()
  
  count := len(farmers) + len(warriors)
  results := make(chan ArmedDweller, count)
  
  // It doesn't matter in which order dwellers get armed
  // Farmers
  for i := 0; i < len(farmers); i++ {
    go func() {
      f := farmers[i]

      weapon := f.FindWeaponAndMaybeDrinkABeerOrTwo()

      // Locked forever. Why? Because I can.
      weapon.Lock() 

      results <- ArmedDweller{&f, &weapon}
    }()
  }
  
  // Warriors
  for i := 0; i < len(warriors); i++ {
    go func() {
      w := warriors[i]

      weapon := w.GetAWeaponFrom(&k.Armory)

      // Locked forever. Why? Because I can, again.
      weapon.Lock() 

      results <- ArmedDweller{&w, &weapon}
    }()
  }
  
  armedDwellers := make([]ArmedDweller, count)

  // Wait until everyone is armed
  for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
    d := <-results
    armedDwellers = append(armedDwellers, d)
  }
  
  return armedDwellers
}
```

*(Psst! It works like [this](https://play.golang.org/p/dVEE-2dj9fw))*
