Once upon a time, there was a princess who was locked in a tower. PHP, a fierce
dragon, guarded her.

Nobody could approach the tower without being cooked by said dragon.

```go
const max = uint64(18446744073709551615)

type Princess struct {
  name string
  beauty uint64
  boredom uint64
  charmingPrince *Knight
  ear chan string
  mouth chan string
}

func newPrincess() *Princess {
  return &Princess{
    name: "Gonderella",
    beauty: max,
    boredom: max,
  }
}

type Dragon struct {
  name string
  ferocity uint64
  life uint8
}

func newDragon() *Dragon {
  return &Dragon{
    name: "PHP",
    ferocity: max,
    life: 255,
  }
}

```

Knights from all kingdoms arrived to fight against the dragon. None survived.

The boredom of the princess was close to `max + 1`. That could destroy the
entire Universe.
