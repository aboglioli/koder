The dragon's brain had forgotten to *seed* the randomness.

```go
rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())
```

For this very reason the seed was always 1: `rand.Seed(1)`.

The time would have been `3h21m0s` if the seed had been the static time of
Playground, but it was 1. This small 1 produced a random time of `4h42m0s`.

The confrontation was imminent. Who said that one line of code could not destroy
the Universe? At least the birds were not singing...
